- Fix keyword argument(s) parameters.
- Bring test coverage back up to 100%
- Figure out a way to avoid recursion so ``loop(print("foo"))`` works as expected.
- Write a testing framework for mio in mio.
- Implement a "trace" hook into the interpreter. i.e: Python's ``sys.settrace()``
- Implement a basic debugger.
- Implement a basic coverage tool.
- Do a refresher on how to write an interpreter in RPython and write a really really simple one:
